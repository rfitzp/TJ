			     		Vacuum solution calculated to enable free-boundary calculations.
 - *FitzpatrickPoP2017.pdf*:		Description of Tomuhawc code, which solves tearing mode dispersion relation in general tokamak
   			     		equilibrium. No limit to number of included poloidal harmonics. Plasma assumed to be up-down
			     		symmetric. No true vacuum solution, so only approximate free-boundary calculations allowed.
