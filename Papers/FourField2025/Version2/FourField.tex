\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Resonant magnetic perturbations}
Externally generated, static (i.e., non-rotating in the laboratory frame), {\em resonant magnetic perturbations}\/ (RMPs) can drive magnetic reconnection in tokamak plasmas that
are intrinsically stable to tearing modes \cite{sco,compass,fish,rf1993,rf1998}. Static RMPs arise naturally as a consequence  of magnetic
field-coil misalignments  \cite{error}, but are sometimes deliberately applied to tokamak plasmas in order to suppress edge-localized modes (ELMs) \cite{elmx}. 
Driven reconnection is significant because it leads to the formation of magnetic island chains at so-called {\em rational}\/ magnetic flux-surfaces within the plasma \cite{boz}. Such chains locally flatten the pressure profile, and, thereby, degrade the plasma energy confinement \cite{chang}. 

The analysis  of the response of a tokamak plasma to an RMP  is most efficiently formulated as an asymptotic matching problem in which the  plasma is  divided into two distinct regions \cite{fkr}.    In the so-called {\em outer region}, which comprises most
of the plasma, the plasma perturbation is governed by the equations of linearized, marginally-stable, ideal-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).
However, these equations become singular on    rational  magnetic flux-surfaces at which the perturbed magnetic field resonates with the equilibrium field. In the {\em inner region}, which
consists of a set of narrow layers centered on the various rational surfaces, non-ideal-MHD effects   become important.

\subsection{Four-field resonant response model}
It is well known that single-fluid resistive-MHD offers a very poor description of
the response of the inner region to the magnetic perturbation in the outer region. 
For instance, the strong  diamagnetic flows present in tokamak plasmas imply that the  electron and ion fluid velocities are significantly different from one another,
necessitating a two-fluid treatment \cite{ara}. Moreover, resistive-MHD does not take  into account the important  ion sound-radius lengthscale below which electron and ion dynamics become decoupled from one another \cite{drake,wal}. Previously, Cole \& Fitzpatrick\,\cite{cole} used the four-field model
of Fitzpatrick \& Waelbroeck \cite{fw}, which consists of four coupled nonlinear partial differential equations,
and which is based on the original four-field model of Hazeltine, Kotschenreuther \& Morrison \cite{haz}, 
to determine the linear two-fluid response of a resonant layer to the perturbation in the outer region. This treatment was extended in Ref.~\cite{rf2022} in order  to take into account the
 anomalously large perpendicular  energy diffusivity  present in tokamak plasmas. 
 
 In configuration space, the four-field models of Refs.~\cite{cole} and \cite{rf2022} yield a set of resonant layer equations that can be expressed as 
 {\em ten}\/  coupled 
 first-order linear ordinary differential equations (o.d.e.s)  \cite{lee}. However, in Fourier space, the resonant layer equations can be written as 
 {\em four}\/  coupled  first-order linear o.d.e.s  \cite{cole}. It is clearly advantageous to solve the equations in Fourier space. In Refs.~\cite{cole}
 and \cite{rf2022}, an approximation is made by which one of the terms in the Fourier-transformed layer equations is neglected. This
 approximation, which is valid in low-$\beta$ plasmas,  is such that the layer equation that governs the parallel ion dynamics decouples from the other three equations, effectively
 converting a four-field resonant response model into a three-field model. Furthermore, the three remaining layer equations can be combined to give a
 single second-order linear o.d.e. This second-order equation is most conveniently solved  by means of a Riccati transformation
 that converts it into a first-order nonlinear o.d.e.\ \cite{ric1,ric2,ric3}. The advantage of the Riccati approach is that it can deal with numerically problematic  solutions
 that blow up as $\exp(p^2)$, or faster, at large $p$, where $p$ is the Fourier-space variable. 
 
 Lee, Park \& Na \cite{lee} recently demonstrated  how to solve the full tenth-order four-field resonant layer equations in configuration space using a Riccati transformation. In the process, they discovered that, in a high-$\beta$ plasma,  the RMP rotation frequency (as seen in the local ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ frame
 at the rational surface)  at which the electromagnetic torque exerted on the plasma in the immediate vicinity of the resonant layer passes through zero is shifted in the ion diamagnetic direction from the electron diamagnetic frequency.
 This result is significant because there is some experimental evidence for such a shift \cite{paz}. 
 
 The first aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the calculation of
 Lee et alia can be reimplemented in Fourier space. The Fourier version of the calculation is more convenient, from a numerical point of view, because
 it involves the solution of a fourth-order, rather than a tenth-order, system of equations. 
 
 \subsection{Magnetically diverted plasmas}
 The safety-factor profile of a magnetically diverted tokamak plasma diverges logarithmically as the magnetic separatrix 
(a.k.a.\ the last closed magnetic flux-surface) is approached. At first sight, this suggests that, when determining the response of such a plasma to an RMP, it is necessary to include an infinite number of rational magnetic flux-surfaces (at which the RMP resonates with the equilibrium magnetic field) in the calculation, the
majority of which lie  very close to the separatrix. In fact, as was demonstrated in Ref.~\cite{rf2025}, when finite plasma resistivity is taken into account, this turns out not to be the case. 
Instead, it is only necessary to include rational surfaces that
lie in the region $0<{\mit\Psi}<1-\epsilon_c$, where ${\mit\Psi}$ is the normalized poloidal magnetic flux, and
$0<\epsilon_c\ll 1$. Moreover, the value of $\epsilon_c$ can be calculated from the plasma parameters at the edge of the discharge. 

The analysis of Ref.~\cite{rf2025} was based on the three-field resonant response model of Refs.~\cite{cole} and \cite{rf2022}.
The second aim of this paper is to generalize this analysis  by employing  the new Fourier-space four-field resonant response model. 

\section{Asymptotic matching}\label{sect1}
\subsection{Plasma equilibrium}
Consider a large aspect-ratio tokamak plasma equilibrium whose magnetic flux-surfaces map out
(almost) concentric circles in the poloidal plane. Such an equilibrium can be approximated as a
periodic cylinder \cite{rf1993}. Let $r$, $\theta$, $z$ be right-handed cylindrical coordinates. 
The magnetic axis corresponds to $r=0$, and the plasma boundary to $r=a$, where $a$ is the simulated minor radius of the plasma. The system is assumed to be periodic in the $z$-direction with periodicity length $2\pi\,R_0$, where $R_0$ is the simulated major radius of the plasma. The
safety-factor profile takes the form $q(r)=r\,B_z/[R_0\,B_\theta(r)]$, where $B_z$ is the constant
``toroidal'' magnetic field-strength, and $B_\theta(r)$ is the poloidal magnetic field-strength. The equilibrium poloidal and toroidal magnetic
fluxes (divided by $2\pi$) are written $\psi_p(r)=B_z\int_0^r r'/q(r')\,dr'$ and $\psi_t(r)=B_z\,r^2/2$, respectively.
The standard
large aspect-ratio tokamak orderings, $r/R_0\ll 1$ and $B_\theta/B_z\ll 1$, are adopted \cite{ric3}. 

\subsection{Outer region}\label{cyl}
Consider an externally generated,  static (in the laboratory frame) magnetic perturbation that has $m$ periods in the poloidal direction, and
$n$ periods in the toroidal direction. 
The response of the plasma to the perturbation is
governed by the linearized equations of marginally-stable ideal-MHD everywhere in the plasma, apart from a (radially) narrow
layer centered on the rational surface whose minor radius, $r_s$,  is such that $q(r_s)=m/n$ \cite{fkr}.

The perturbed magnetic field is written $\delta{\bf B} \simeq \nabla\delta\psi\times{\bf e}_z$,  
where
$\delta\psi(r,\theta,\varphi)= \delta\psi(r)\,\exp[\,{\rm i}\,(m\,\theta-n\,\varphi)]$, 
and $\varphi=z/R_0$ is a simulated toroidal angle. 
In the outer region  (i.e., everywhere in the plasma
apart from the resonant layer), the perturbed helical magnetic flux, $\delta\psi(r)$, satisfies the
{\em cylindrical tearing mode equation}\/  \cite{ric3,cyl,wes},
\begin{equation}\label{e3}
\frac{d^2 \delta\psi}{d r^2} + \frac{1}{r}\,\frac{d \delta\psi}{dr}-\frac{m^2}{r^2}\,\delta\psi - \frac{J_z'\,\delta\psi}{r\,(1/q-n/m)}=  0,
\end{equation}
where 
$J_z(r)= R_0\,\mu_0\,j_z(r)/B_z$,
and $j_z(r)$ is the equilibrium ``toroidal'' current density. Here, $'\equiv d/dr$. 

In general, the solution of Eq.~(\ref{e3}) that satisfies physical
boundary conditions at the magnetic axis and the plasma boundary is such that $\delta\psi(r)$ is continuous
across the rational surface, whereas $d\delta\psi/dr$ is discontinuous. The discontinuity of
 $d\delta\psi/dr$ across the rational surface is indicative of the presence of a helical current
 sheet at the surface.  The complex quantity ${\mit\Psi}_s= \delta\psi(r_s)$ determines the amplitude
 and phase of the reconnected helical magnetic flux at the rational surface, whereas the complex quantity 
 \begin{equation}
{\mit\Delta\Psi}_{\!s} = \left[r\,\frac{d\delta\psi}{dr}\right]_{r_{s-}}^{r_{s+}}
\end{equation}
parameterizes the amplitude and phase of the helical current sheet \cite{rf1993}. 

The solution of
the cylindrical tearing mode equation in the outer region, in the presence the RMP,  leads to a {\em tearing mode dispersion relation}\/ of the form \cite{rf1993,fkr}
\begin{equation}\label{e110}
{\mit\Delta\Psi}_{\!s}- E_{ss}\,{\mit\Psi}_s = -E_{ss}\,{\mit\Psi}_v,
\end{equation}
where $E_{ss}$ is a real dimensionless quantity known as the {\em tearing stability index}\/ \cite{fkr}. Moreover,
${\mit\Psi}_v$ is the so-called {\em vacuum flux}, and is defined as the reconnected magnetic flux
that would be driven at the rational surface by the RMP were the
plasma intrinsically tearing-stable (i.e., $E_{ss} <0$), and were there no current sheet at the rational surface
(i.e., ${\mit\Delta\Psi}_{\!s}=0$) \cite{rf1993}. 

In the following, it is assumed that $E_{ss}<0$, which implies that the tearing mode that
reconnects magnetic flux at the rational surface is intrinsically stable. In this case, any magnetic reconnection that takes place at the
surface is entirely due to the RMP.

\end{table}

\subsection{Inner region}
The current sheet at the rational surface is resolved by employing a two-fluid resistive-MHD resonant response model
in the  inner region (i.e., the region of the plasma in the immediate vicinity of the rational surface) to determine the
complex {\em layer response index}, ${\mit\Delta}_s$. Asymptotic matching between the solutions in the inner and the outer regions
yields
\begin{equation}\label{e4g}
{\mit\Delta}_s= \frac{{\mit\Delta\Psi}_{\!s}}{{\mit\Psi}_s}.
\end{equation}
The previous two equations lead to the {\em plasma response equation}, 
\begin{equation}\label{response}
{\mit\Psi}_s = \frac{{\mit\Psi}_v}{1+{\mit\Delta}_s/(-E_{ss})}.
\end{equation}

Note that if $|{\mit\Delta}_s|/(-E_{ss})\ll 1$ then ${\mit\Psi}_s\simeq {\mit\Psi}_v$ and ${\mit\Delta\Psi}_{\!s}\simeq 0$, 
which is termed a {\em vacuum response}. On the other hand, if $|{\mit\Delta}_s|/(-E_{ss})\gg 1$ then $|{\mit\Psi}_s|\ll |{\mit\Psi}_v|$,
which is termed an {\em ideal response}. In the vacuum response regime, the current sheet that is excited in the resonant layer is too feeble
to prevent driven magnetic reconnection, and the reconnected flux at the rational surface is the same as that which would
be driven if there were no plasma present at the surface. On the other hand, in the ideal response regime, the  current sheet excited in the layer is
large enough to almost completely suppress driven magnetic reconnection, which implies that the response of the plasma is equivalent
to that which would occur if the ideal-MHD flux freezing constraint, ${\mit\Psi}_s=0$, were imposed at the rational surface \cite{rf2025}. 

\section{Fourier-space four-field resonant response model}
\subsection{Introduction}
The Fourier-space  four-field resonant response model employed in this paper is described in detail in Appendix~\ref{sfour}. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figure1.pdf}}
\caption{The scaled layer response index, $\hat{\mit\Delta}$, plotted as a function of the normalized ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ frequency, $Q_E$, in
the first Hall-resistive (HRi) response regime. (See Table~\ref{t1}.)  $\hat{\mit\Delta}_3$ is the response index predicted by the three-field Fourier-space
response model of Ref.~\cite{rf2022}. $\hat{\mit\Delta}_4$ is the response index predicted by the four-field Fourier-space
response model specified in Appendix~\ref{sfour}. SLAYER is the response index predicted by the four-field configuration-space response model of
Ref.~\cite{lee}. The three vertical lines indicate the electron fluid resonance, $Q_E+Q_e=0$, the MHD fluid resonance, $Q_E=0$,
and the ion fluid resonance, $Q_E+Q_i=0$, respectively, in order from the left to the right.}\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dimensionless parameters}
All four-field resonant response models are defined by the following seven dimensionless parameters:
 $Q_E=-S^{1/3}\,n\,\omega_E\,\tau_H$, $Q_e=-S^{1/3}\,n\,\omega_{\ast\,e}\,\tau_H$, $Q_i=
-S^{1/3}\,n\,\omega_{\ast\,i}\,\tau_H$, $c_\beta=\sqrt{\beta/(1+\beta)}$, $D=S^{1/3}\,\iota_e^{\,1/2}\,\hat{d}_\beta$, $P_E=\tau_R/\tau_E$,  and $P_\varphi=\tau_R/\tau_\varphi$. 
Here, $\tau_R$ is the resistive diffusion timescale, $\tau_H$ the hydrodynamic timescale, $\tau_E$ the energy confinement timescale,
$\tau_\varphi$ the momentum confinement timescale, $S=\tau_R/\tau_H$ the Lundquist number, $\omega_E$ the ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ frequency, $\omega_{\ast\,e}$ the
electron diamagnetic frequency, $\omega_{\ast\,i}$ the ion diamagnetic frequency, $\sqrt{\beta}=\sqrt{(5/3)\,\mu_0\,p}/B_z$ the ratio of the sound speed
to the Alfv\'{e}n speed, $p$ the plasma pressure, $d_\beta=c_\beta\,d_i$ the ion sound-radius, and $d_i$ the collisionless ion skin-depth.  Moreover,
$P_E$ and $P_\varphi$ are magnetic Prandtl numbers, 
$\iota_e = - \omega_{\ast\,e}/(\omega_{\ast\,i}-\omega_{\ast\,e})$, and $\hat{d}_\beta= d_\beta/r_s$. All quantities are evaluated at the
rational surface. (See Appendix~\ref{sfour} for more detailed definitions.)

Note that the previous definitions are slightly different to those adopted in Ref.~\cite{lee}. We can convert our dimensionless parameter  into
into those used by Lee et alia by letting $Q_E\rightarrow Q$, $Q_e\rightarrow -Q_{\ast\,e}$, $Q_i\rightarrow -Q_{\ast\,i}$, $\iota_e\rightarrow 1/(1+\tau)$, $P_E\rightarrow c_\beta^{\,2}$, and 
 $P_\varphi\rightarrow P$.

\caption{ The scaled layer response index, $\hat{\mit\Delta}$, plotted as a function of the normalized ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ frequency, $Q_E$, in
the second Hall-resistive (HRii) response regime. See Table~\ref{t1} and the caption to Fig.~\ref{fig1}. }\label{fig2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Method of solution}
After linearization and Fourier transformation (with respect to $x=r-r_s$), our four-field equations can be converted into  the  Ricatti matrix
differential equation 
\begin{equation}
p\,\frac{d\underline{\underline{W}}}{dp} = \underline{\underline{W}} - \underline{\underline{W}}\,\underline{\underline{W}} - \underline{\underline{E}}\,\underline{\underline{W}}
+\underline{\underline{F}}. 
\end{equation}
 Here, $p$ is the Fourier transform variable, and $\underline{\underline{W}}(p)$  the $2\times 2$ solution matrix. The elements of the $2\times 2$ matrices $\underline{\underline{E}}(p)$ and
$\underline{\underline{F}}(p)$ are specified in Eqs.~(\ref{ee1})--(\ref{ee4}) and (\ref{f1})--(\ref{f4}), respectively.  The method of solution is as follows. A solution of the Ricatti equation
is launched from a large (with respect to unity) value of $p$, with the initial solution matrix specified in Eq.~(\ref{e147}), and
is then integrated to a small (with respect to unity) value of $p$. The {\em scaled layer response index}, $\hat{\mit\Delta}$, is then deduced from  the small-$p$ elements of the solution matrix
by means of Eq.~(\ref{e111}). The
true layer response index is ${\mit\Delta}_s=S^{1/3}\,\hat{\mit\Delta}$.

\subsection{Benchmarking against SLAYER}
Our first task is to benchmark the results of our Fourier-space calculation of $\hat{\mit\Delta}$ against the results of the configuration-space
calculation  performed by Lee et alia. The latter calculation has been implemented in the SLAYER code \cite{lee,ric2}. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figure3.pdf}}
\caption{The scaled layer response index, $\hat{\mit\Delta}$, plotted as a function of the normalized ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ frequency, $Q_E$, in
the second resistive-inertial (RIii) response regime. See Table~\ref{t1} and the caption to Fig.~\ref{fig1}.  }\label{fig3}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig1}--\ref{fig4} show the scaled layer response index, $\hat{\mit\Delta}$, calculated as a function of the normalized ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$
frequency, $Q_E$, by three different solution methods, in four of the analytic layer response regimes identified in Ref.~\cite{cole}. The dimensionless 
layer parameters used in the four calculations are specified in Table~\ref{t1}. 
The first solution
method involves using the Fourier-space analysis of Ref.~\cite{rf2022}. In this analysis, the term involving $c_\beta^{\,2}$ is neglected in Eq.~(\ref{e316}).
Consequently, Eq.~(\ref{e317}) decouples from Eqs.~(\ref{e314})--(\ref{e316a}), which effectively converts a four-field response model 
(the four fields being $\bar{\psi}$, $\bar{N}$, $\bar{\phi}$, and $\bar{V}$) into a three-field response model (the three fields being $\bar{\psi}$, $\bar{N}$, 
and $\bar{\phi}$). The second solution method involves using the Fourier-space analysis set out in Appendix~\ref{sfour}. This method
 solves  Eqs.~(\ref{e314})--(\ref{e317}), with no neglected terms, and thus constitutes   a four-field response model. The first two methods have
 been implemented in the TJ code \cite{tj,tj1}. 
 The third solution method
involves using the configuration-space analysis of Ref.~\cite{lee}, which is implemented in the SLAYER code  \cite{ric2}.   Solution methods two and three  constitute equivalent four-field response models. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figure4.pdf}}
\caption{The scaled layer response index, $\hat{\mit\Delta}$, plotted as a function of the normalized ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ frequency, $Q_E$, in
the second viscous-resistive (VRii) response regime. See Table~\ref{t1} and the caption to Fig.~\ref{fig1}. }\label{fig4}
\end{figure}

It is clear from Figs.~\ref{fig1}--\ref{fig4} that the second and third solution methods yield exactly the same results. This is remarkable because
the second method involves solving four coupled first-order o.d.e.s in Fourier space, whereas the third involves solving ten coupled first-order o.d.e.s
in configuration space. Moreover, as is clear from a comparison of Appendix~\ref{sfour} and Ref.~\cite{lee},  the analysis that leads to the
four coupled equations in the former method is radically different from, and completely independent of, that which leads to the ten
coupled equations in the latter method. It follows that the two solution methods constitute strong independent checks on one another. 
Hence, we can be confident that the two methods are valid, and also that they have been implemented correctly in the TJ and SLAYER codes. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figure5.pdf}}
\caption{The difference between the scaled layer response indices predicted by the three-field and the four-field Fourier-space resonant
response models plotted as a function of
the normalized   ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ frequency, $Q_E$. The calculations are performed in the VRii regime of Table~\ref{t1}, but for various different values of $c_\beta$. 
See the caption to Fig.~\ref{fig1}.}\label{fig5}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Effect of $c_\beta$}
In Figs.~\ref{fig1}--\ref{fig4}, the {\em electron fluid resonance}, $Q_E+Q_e=0$, the {\em MHD-fluid resonance}, $Q_E=0$, and the {\em ion fluid
resonance}, $Q_E+Q_i=0$, are highlighted. The electron fluid resonance corresponds to the situation in which the rotation frequency of the electron fluid
at the rational surface  passes through zero, which we would expect to maximize the interaction between the electron
fluid and the static RMP. Likewise for the other fluid resonances. 

Figures~\ref{fig1}--\ref{fig4} allow us to assess the consequences of neglecting the term involving $c_\beta^{\,2}$ in Eq.~(\ref{e316}) by looking
at the difference between $\hat{\mit\Delta}_4$ and $\hat{\mit\Delta}_3$. 
Obviously, this neglect is unlikely  to make a significant difference if the ion sound parameter, $c_\beta$, is much less than unity, which explains
why the rather large value, $c_\beta=1$, is used in the calculations shown in the figures. (See Table~\ref{t1}.) It can be seen from the figures that
the neglect of the $c_\beta^{\,2}$ term has a larger relative effect on the real part of the scaled layer response index, $\hat{\mit\Delta}$,  than on the imaginary part.
Furthermore, Figs.~\ref{fig2} and \ref{fig3} indicate that if the $c_\beta^{\,2}$ term is neglected then the plasma response model fails to capture resonant behavior
that occurs, in some response regimes,  close to the MHD-fluid resonance ($Q_E=0$). All four figures indicate that if the $c_\beta^{\,2}$ term is neglected then the real and the imaginary parts
of the response index pass simultaneously through zero  at the electron fluid resonance ($Q_E+Q_e=0$). From Eq.~(\ref{response}), this implies a
complete loss of shielding at the electron fluid resonance, leading to a vacuum-like response in which the reconnected magnetic flux
driven at the rational surface is maximized. The figures also indicate that if the $c_\beta^{\,2}$ term is retained then 
the value of $Q_E$  at which the imaginary part of the scaled response index passes through zero shifts from the electron fluid
resonance in the direction of the ion fluid resonance. The value of $Q_E$ at which the real part of the scaled response index passes through zero also shifts from the electron fluid resonance. However, the direction of the shift is different in different response regimes.

Figure~\ref{fig5} shows the difference between the scaled layer response index predicted by the three-field (i.e., $c_\beta^{\,2}=0$) Fourier-space  resonant response model of Ref.~\cite{rf2022} and the
four-field Fourier-space resonant response model of Appendix~\ref{sfour}. The calculations are performed using the $Q_e$, $Q_i$, $D$, $P_E$,
and $P_\varphi$ values associated with the VRii regime of Table~\ref{t1}, and for various different values of $c_\beta$.  It can be seen that the
difference between the predictions of the three-field and four-field  models is an increasing function of increasing $c_\beta$, and that the difference is essentially
negligible for $c_\beta$ values less than $0.01$.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figure6.pdf}}
\caption{The critical value of the normalized electron fluid rotation frequency at the rational surface, $Q_E+Q_e$, 
at which the real (dashed curves) and imaginary (solid curves) components of the layer response index pass through zero, plotted as a function of $c_\beta$ for the
four response regimes specified in Table~\ref{t1}.}\label{fig6}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig6} shows the critical value of the normalized electron fluid rotation frequency at the rational surface, $Q_E+Q_e$,
at which the real and imaginary parts of the scaled layer response index, $\hat{\mit\Delta}$,  pass through  zero, plotted as a function of $c_\beta$. The calculations are performed
using the  $Q_e$, $Q_i$, $D$, $P_E$,
and $P_\varphi$ values associated with the HRi, HRii, RIii, and VRii regimes of Table~\ref{t1}. 
As we have seen, if $c_\beta=0$ then the real and the imaginary components of $\hat{\mit\Delta}$ pass through zero simultaneously as the electron fluid rotation frequency 
passes through zero. However, as is clear from the figure,  as $c_\beta$ increases from zero, the critical value of the electron fluid rotation frequency
at which the real part of the scaled layer response index passes through zero shifts in the electron diamagnetic direction (i.e., to more negative values of $Q_E+Q_e$), whereas that 
at which the imaginary part passes through zero shifts in opposite direction. The only exception to this
rule occurs in the second resistive-inertial (RIii) regime, where  the critical values of the electron fluid rotation frequency at which the real and imaginary parts of the scaled layer response index pass through zero
both shift in the ion diamagnetic direction by almost equal amounts. According to Eq.~(\ref{response}), a vacuum response  (i.e., ${\mit\Psi}\simeq {\mit\Psi}_v$) 
requires  the real and the imaginary parts of the scaled plasma response index to be simultaneously much smaller than unity (given that the true layer response index is ${\mit\Delta}_s=S^{1/3}\,\hat{\mit\Delta}$, 
whereas, under normal circumstances, $-E_{ss}\sim {\cal O}(1)$, and 
$S\gg 1$). As $c_\beta$ increases, this state of affairs seems to become progressively harder to achieve, except in the RIii regime. 

\section{Response of  the pedestal region of tokamak plasma to an RMP}
\subsection{Edge-localized modes}
Magnetically diverted tokamak plasmas generally operate in so-called {\em H-mode} \cite{hmode}. In this  operation mode, a transport barrier forms in the outer part of 
the plasma, leading to a region of enhanced density and temperature gradients known as the {\em pedestal}. As the name suggests, the ``pedestal''
is characterized  by negative steps in the density and temperature profiles that are located just inside the plasma boundary. (See Fig.~\ref{f7}.) 
Unfortunately, the large pressure gradient present in the pedestal can drive ideal-MHD instabilities known as {\em peeling-ballooning modes} \cite{pb}. Consequently, most H-mode plasmas exhibit intermittent bursts of heat and particle transport, emanating from the pedestal, that are known as (type-I)
{\em edge-localized modes}  (ELMs) \cite{elm}.  It is estimated that the heat load that ELMs will
deliver to the tungsten plasma-facing components in a reactor-scale
tokamak will be large enough to cause massive tungsten ion influx
into the plasma core, and that the erosion associated with this process will
unacceptably limit the lifetimes of these components \cite{elm1}. Consequently,
the development of robust and effective methods for ELM control is a
high priority for the international magnetic fusion program.

\subsection{RMP-induced ELM suppression} 
The most promising method for the control of ELMs is via the
application of externally generated, static, RPMs to the plasma, 
Complete RMP-induced ELM suppression was first demonstrated on
the DIII-D tokamak \cite{elmx}. Subsequently, either mitigation or complete suppression of ELMs via RMPs has been demonstrated on the JET \cite{rmp2}, ASDEX-U \cite{rmp3}, 
KSTAR, \cite{rmp4} MAST \cite{rmp5}, EAST \cite{rmp6}, and MAST-U \cite{rmp7} tokamaks.

If an RMP opens up a magnetic island chain at the foot of the pedestal then it gives rise to an undesirable  phenomenon, known as a
{\em density pump-out}, by which the density gradient in the pedestal  is greatly reduced \cite{hu,hu1,hu2}. On the other hand,
if an RMP opens up a magnetic island chain at the top of the pedestal then it generally suppresses ELMs  \cite{hu,hu1,hu2,hu3,hu4}, because the
island chain limits the width and height of the pedestal, and, thereby, prevents the peeling-ballooning instability threshold from being crossed \cite{pb}. 

In the following, we shall construct a simple model of a pedestal in the ITER tokamak, and then use our Fourier-space, four-field, resonant
response model to gauge the response of this model pedestal to a  externally generated, static, RMP.

\subsection{Model ITER pedestal}
We shall again employ the cylindrical analysis of  Sect.~\ref{sect1}. Let the normalized toroidal plasma current take the
form 
\begin{equation}\label{Jdef}
J_z(\hat{r}) = \frac{2}{q_0}\,(1-\hat{r}^{\,2})^{\nu_q-1},
\end{equation}
where $\hat{r}=r/a$. The model safety-factor profile is written
\begin{equation}\label{eq}
q(\hat{r}) =\frac{ \nu_q\,q_0\,\hat{r}^{\,2}}{1- (1-\hat{r}^{\,2})^{\nu_q}} -\alpha_q\,\ln(1-\hat{r}^{\,2}) - \frac{{\mit\Delta}_q}{2}\!
\left[1+\tanh\left(\frac{\hat{r}-\hat{r}_q}{\delta_q}\right)\right].
\end{equation}
The first term on the right-hand side of the previous equation is the safety-factor profile that cylindrical theory would associate with the current profile
specified in Eq.~(\ref{Jdef})  \cite{wes}.  Here, $q_0$ is the cylindrical safety-factor on the magnetic axis ($\hat{r}=0$), whereas
$\nu_q\,q_0$ is the cylindrical safety-factor at the plasma boundary ($\hat{r}=1$). The second term is intended  to mimic the logarithmic singularity in the $q$-profile that occurs
at the edge of a magnetically diverted plasma (assuming that the magnetic separatrix corresponds to $\hat{r}=1$) \cite{rf2025}. 
The final term is meant to represent the reduction in the magnetic shear generated by the strong, pressure-gradient-driven, bootstrap 
current \cite{bootstrap} present in the pedestal
of an H-mode plasma. (See, for example, Fig.~6 of Ref.~\cite{rfx} and Fig.~1 of Ref.~\cite{sar}.)  The approach taken here is similar to that taken in the TM1 code, which employs cylindrical geometry in association
with experimental  safety-factor, density, and temperature profiles \cite{tm1,tm2}. This approach has been very successful at explaining
RMP-induced density pump-out and  ELM suppression in the DIII-D tokamak \cite{hu,hu1,hu2}. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figure7.pdf}}
\caption{Safety-factor, magnetic shear, electron number density, and electron and ion temperature profiles used to model ITER pedestal. } \label{fig7}
\end{figure}

The model electron number density, electron temperature, and ion temperature profiles take the respective forms
\begin{align}
n_e(\hat{r}) &=(n_{e\,0}-n_{e\,1})\,(1-\hat{r}^{\,2})^{\nu_{n_e}} + \frac{{\mit\Delta}_{n_e}}{2}\!
\left[1+\tanh\left(\frac{\hat{r}-\hat{r}_{n_e}}{\delta_{n_e}}\right)\right] + n_{e\,1},\\[0.5ex]
T_e(\hat{r}) &=(T_{e\,0}-T_{e\,1})\,(1-\hat{r}^{\,2})^{\nu_{T_e}} + \frac{{\mit\Delta}_{T_e}}{2}\!
\left[1+\tanh\left(\frac{\hat{r}-\hat{r}_{T_e}}{\delta_{T_e}}\right)\right] + T_{e\,1},\\[0.5ex]
T_i(\hat{r}) &=(T_{i\,0}-T_{i\,1})\,(1-\hat{r}^{\,2})^{\nu_{T_i}} + \frac{{\mit\Delta}_{T_i}}{2}\!
\left[1+\tanh\left(\frac{\hat{r}-\hat{r}_{T_i}}{\delta_{T_i}}\right)\right] + T_{i\,1}.
\end{align}
Here, the second terms on the right-hand sides of the previous three equations  represent the negative steps in the
three profiles in the pedestal region. 

The parameters used in our model ITER pedestal are specified in Table~\ref{t2}. The electron number density and electron and ion temperature profiles  approximately reproduce the model profiles shown in Fig.~8 of Ref.~\cite{crystal}. Our model pedestal is characterized by $q_{95} =3.70$, $n_e(1)=2.2\times 10^{19}\,{\rm m}^{-3}$, $T_e(1)= 106\,{\rm eV}$, and
$T_i(1)= 97\,{\rm eV}$. The magnetic shear attains its minimum value of $s=0.21$ at $\hat{r}= 0.937$. 

The parallel electrical resistivity of the plasma is \cite{ric3}
\begin{equation}
\eta_\parallel = \frac{0.51\,\ln{\mit\Lambda}\,Z\,m_e^{\,1/2}\,e^{1/2}}{6\sqrt{2}\,\pi^{\,3/2}\,f_p\,\epsilon_0^{\,2}\,T_e^{\,3/2}}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
\ln{\mit\Lambda} &= 24 - \ln\left[\left(\frac{n_e}{10^6}\right)^{1/2}\,\frac{1}{T_e}\right],\\[0.5ex]
f_p &= 1 - 1.46\left(\frac{\hat{r}\,a}{R_0}\right)^{1/2} + 0.46\left(\frac{\hat{r}\,a}{R_0}\right)^{3/2}.\label{fp}
\end{align}
Here, $n_e$ is measured in SI units, whereas $T_e$ is measured in units of eV. Moreover, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $e$ the magnitude of the electron charge,
$Z=3.0$ the effective ion charge number, $R_0=5.3\,{\rm m}$ the plasma major radius, and $a=2.0\,{\rm m}$ the plasma minor radius \cite{hartwig}. 
The factor $f_p$ accounts for the neoclassical enhancement of resistivity \cite{hinton}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figure8.pdf}}
\caption{Rotation frequency profiles in the model ITER pedestal. Here, $\omega_{\ast\,e}$ is the electron diamagnetic frequency, 
$\omega_{\ast\,i}$  the ion diamagnetic frequency,  $\omega_E$ the ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ frequency, and
$\omega_{\perp\,e}=\omega_E+\omega_{\ast\,e}$ the electron fluid rotation frequency. All frequencies are in radians per second. }
 \label{fig8}
\end{figure}

All of the remaining plasma parameter, apart from the ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ rotation profile, can be calculated from their definitions given in Appendix~\ref{sfour},  
the profile data specified in Eqs.~(\ref{eq})--(\ref{fp}) and Table~\ref{t2}, and the following information.  The vacuum toroidal magnetic
field-strength is $B_0 = 5.3\,{\rm T}$ \cite{hartwig}, the ion mass number is $M=2$, and the perpendicular energy and momentum diffusivities
take the (spatially) constant values  $\chi_E=1\,{\rm m^2/s}$ and $\chi_\varphi = 1\,{\rm m^2/s}$, respectively \cite{wes1}. 

Figure~\ref{fig8} shows the rotation frequencies in our model ITER pedestal. The adopted ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ frequency profile is
written
\begin{equation}
\omega_E(\hat{r}) =\omega_{E\,0}\,(1-\hat{r}^{\,2})^{\nu_E}+  \alpha_E\,\omega_{\ast\,e},
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{E\,0} = 3\times 10^4\,{\rm rad./s}$, $\nu_E= 1.1$, and $\alpha_E= 0.3$. The adopted ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ frequency profile
has the appropriate sign in the pedestal and the core \cite{sar,crystal}, and is designed to ensure that the electron fluid rotation frequency,
$\omega_{\perp\,e}=\omega_E +\omega_{\ast\,e}$, passes through zero close to the top of the pedestal. This feature of the electron
fluid rotation frequency is almost always observed in H-mode tokamak plasmas with co-current neutral beam injection, and has been
identified as a key feature in RMP-induced ELM suppression \cite{hu,hu1,hu2,hu3,hu4}.

\appendix
\section{Fourier-space four-field resonant plasma response model}\label{sfour}
\subsection{Fundamental definitions}
The plasma is assumed to consist of two species. First, electrons of mass $m_e$, electrical charge $-e$, 
number density $n_e$, and temperature $T_e$.  Second, ions of mass $m_i$, electrical charge $+e$,  
number density $n_e$, and temperature $T_i$. Let $p=n_e\,(T_e+T_i)$ be the total plasma pressure. 

Let $r_s$ be the minor radius of the rational surface. It is helpful to define $n_0 = n_e(r_s)$, $p_0= p(r_s)$, \cite{ric3}
\begin{align}
\eta_e &=\left.\frac{d\ln T_e}{d\ln n_e}\right|_{r=r_s},\label{e211}\\[0.5ex]
\eta_i &= \left.\frac{d\ln T_i}{d\ln n_e}\right|_{r=r_s},\\[0.5ex]
\iota&= \left(\frac{T_e}{T_i}\right)_{r=r_s}\left(\frac{1+\eta_e}{1+\eta_i}\right)=\left(\frac{dp_e}{dp_i}\right)_{r_s},\label{e213}
\end{align}
where $n_e(r)$, $p(r)$, $p_e(r)$, $p_i(r)$, $T_e(r)$, and $T_i(r)$ refer to
electron number density, total pressure, electron pressure, ion pressure, electron temperature, and ion temperature profiles, respectively, in the absence of the magnetic perturbation. 

For the sake of simplicity, the perturbed electron and ion temperature profiles are assumed to be functions of
the perturbed electron number density profile in the immediate vicinity of the rational surface. In other words, $T_e=T_e(n_e)$ and $T_i=T_i(n_e)$. This
implies that $p=p(n_e)$. 
The ``MHD velocity'', which is the velocity of a
fictional MHD fluid \cite{haz1}, is defined ${\bf V}={\bf V}_E + V_{\parallel\,i}\,{\bf b}$, where ${\bf V}_E$ is the
${\bf E}\times{\bf B}$ drift velocity, $V_{\parallel\,i}$ is the parallel component of the ion fluid
velocity, ${\bf b}= {\bf B}/|{\bf B}|$, and ${\bf B}$ is the magnetic field-strength.

\subsection{Fundamental fields}
The four fundamental fields in our four-field model---namely, $\psi$, $N$, $\phi$, and $V$---have the following
definitions \cite{ric3}:
\begin{align}\label{e10}
\nabla\psi &= \frac{{\bf e}_\parallel\times{\bf B}} {r_s\,B_z},\\[0.5ex]
N &=-\hat{d}_i\left(\frac{p-p_0}{B_z^{\,2}/\mu_0}\right),\\[0.5ex]
\nabla\phi &= \frac{{\bf e}_{\parallel}\times {\bf V}}{r_s\,V_A},\\[0.5ex]
V &= \hat{d}_i\left(\frac{{\bf e}_{\parallel}\cdot {\bf V}}{V_A}\right).\label{e13}
\end{align}
Here,   ${\bf e}_{\parallel} = (0,\,\epsilon/q_s,\,1)$, $\epsilon = r/R_0$, $q_s=m/n$, 
$V_A =(B_z/\sqrt{\mu_0\,n_0\,m_i})_{r_s}$, 
$d_i =\sqrt{m_i/(n_0\,e^{\,2}\,\mu_0)}_{r_s}$,
and $\hat{d}_i=d_i/r_s$. 
 Our
model also employs the auxiliary field
\begin{align}\label{e16}
J=-\frac{2\,\epsilon_s}{q_s}+\hat{\nabla}^2\psi,
\end{align}
where 
$\epsilon_s=r_s/R_0$, and $\hat{\nabla} = r_s\,\nabla$. Note that $V_A$ is the {\em Alfv\'{e}n speed}\/ at the rational surface, whereas $d_i$ is the {\em collisionless ion skin-depth}. 

\subsection{Fundamental equations}
For the case of a static (in the laboratory frame) magnetic perturbation, the four-field model takes the form \cite{cole,fw,rf2022,ric3}:
\begin{align}\label{e12v}
0&= [\phi,\psi] -\iota_e\,[N,\psi]
+\hat{\eta}_\parallel\,J + \hat{E}_\parallel,\\[0.5ex]
0&= [\phi,N] +\hat{d}_\beta^{\,2}\,[J,\psi]+c_\beta^{\,2}\,[V,\psi] 
+ \hat{\chi}_E\,\hat{\nabla}^{2}N,\\[0.5ex]
0&= [\phi,\hat{\nabla}^2\phi] - \frac{\iota_i}{2}\left(\hat{\nabla}^2[\phi,N] + [\hat{\nabla}^2\phi,N] + [\hat{\nabla}^2 N,\phi]\right) + [J,\psi] +\hat{\chi}_\varphi  \,\hat{\nabla}^4\!\left(\phi + \iota_i\,N\right), \\[0.5ex]
0&= [\phi,V] +[N,\psi] + \hat{\chi}_\varphi\,\hat{\nabla}^2 V.\label{e21}
\end{align}
Here, $[A,B]\equiv \hat{\nabla} A\times \hat{\nabla} B\cdot {\bf e}_{\parallel}$, $\iota_e=\iota/(1+\iota)$, $\iota_i=1/(1+\iota)$, $\hat{t} = t/(r_s/V_A)$, $\hat{\eta}_{\parallel} = \eta_{\parallel}/(\mu_0\,r_s\,V_A)$, $\hat{E}_\parallel = E_\parallel/(B_z\,V_A)$, 
$\hat{\chi}_E= \chi_E/(r_s\,V_A)$, $\hat{\chi}_\varphi= \chi_\varphi/(r_s\,V_A)$, where $\eta_{\parallel}$ is the parallel  plasma electrical
resistivity at the rational surface, $E_\parallel$ the parallel inductive electric field that maintains the equilibrium toroidal
plasma current in the vicinity of the rational surface, $\chi_E$ the anomalous perpendicular heat diffusivity at the
rational surface, and $\chi_\varphi$  the anomalous perpendicular ion momentum
diffusivity at the rational surface. 
Moreover, $d_\beta=c_\beta\,d_i$, and $\hat{d}_\beta=d_\beta/r_s$, where $c_\beta =[\beta/(1+\beta)]^{1/2}_{r_s}$, and
$\beta=(5/3)\,\mu_0\,p_0/B_z^{\,2}$. Here, $d_\beta$ is usually referred to as the {\em ion sound-radius}.  

\subsection{Matching to plasma equilibrium}
The unperturbed plasma equilibrium is such that 
${\bf B} = (0,\,B_\theta(r),\,B_z)$,  $p = p(r)$,
${\bf V} = (0,\,V_E(r),\,V_z(r))$,
where 
$V_E(r)\simeq -E_r/B_z$
 is the (dominant $\theta$-component of the) ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ velocity. Now, the resonant layer is assumed to have a radial thickness that is
much smaller than $r_s$.   Hence, we only need to evaluate plasma equilibrium quantities in the immediate vicinity of the rational
surface. Equations~(\ref{e10})--(\ref{e13}) suggest that \cite{ric3}
\begin{align}
\psi(\hat{x})&= \frac{\hat{x}^{\,2}}{2\,\hat{L}_s},\label{e23}\\[0.5ex]
N(\hat{x}) &= -\hat{V}_\ast\,\hat{x},\\[0.5ex]
\phi(\hat{x}) &= - \hat{V}_E\,\hat{x},\\[0.5ex]
V (\hat{x})&= \hat{V}_\parallel,\label{e26}
\end{align}
where 
$\hat{x}=(r-r_s)/r_s$,
 $\hat{L}_s=L_s/r_s$,  $L_s=R_0\,q_s/s_s$, 
  $\hat{V}_E= V_E(r_s)/V_A$,
$\hat{V}_\ast= V_\ast(r_s)/V_A$,
$V_\ast(r) = (dp/dr)/(e\,n_0\,B_z)$ 
is the (dominant $\theta$-component of the) diamagnetic velocity,
  and 
 $\hat{V}_\parallel=\hat{d}_i\, V_z(r_s)/V_A$. Here, $s_s=s(r_s)$ and $s(r)=d\ln q/d\ln r$. We also have
 \begin{align}\label{e28}
 J (\hat{x})&= -\left(\frac{2}{s_s}-1\right)\frac{1}{\hat{L}_s},
\end{align} 
and $ \hat{E}_\parallel(\hat{x}) =(2/s_s-1)\, (\hat{\eta}_\parallel/\hat{L}_s)$.

\subsection{Derivation of linear layer equations}
In accordance with Eqs.~(\ref{e23})--(\ref{e28}), let us write \cite{ric3}
\begin{align}\label{e31}
\psi(\hat{x},\zeta) &= \frac{\hat{x}^{\,2} }{2\,\hat{L}_s}+ \tilde{\psi}(\hat{x})\,{\rm e}^{\,{\rm i}\,\zeta},\\[0.5ex]
\phi(\hat{x},\zeta) &=-\hat{V}_E\,\hat{x}+ \tilde{\phi}(\hat{x})\,{\rm e}^{\,{\rm i}\,\zeta},\\[0.5ex]
N(\hat{x},\zeta) &= -\hat{V}_\ast\,\hat{x}+\iota_e\,\tilde{N}(\hat{x})\,{\rm e}^{\,{\rm i}\,\zeta},\\[0.5ex]
V(\hat{x},\zeta) &= \hat{V}_\parallel +\iota_e\,\tilde{V}(\hat{x})\,{\rm e}^{\,{\rm i}\,\zeta},\\[0.5ex]
J(\hat{x},\zeta) &=-\left(\frac{2}{s_s}-1\right)\!\frac{1}{\hat{L}_s}+ \hat{\nabla}^2\tilde{\psi}(\hat{x})\,{\rm e}^{\,{\rm i}\,\zeta},\label{e36}
\end{align}
where $\zeta=m\,\theta-n\,\varphi$. 
Substituting Eqs.~(\ref{e31})--(\ref{e36}) into Eqs.~(\ref{e16})--(\ref{e21}), 
 and only retaining terms that
are first order in perturbed quantities, we obtain the following set of linear equations:
\begin{align}\label{e37}
-{\rm i}\,n\,(\omega_E +\omega_{\ast\,e})\,\tau_H\,\tilde{\psi} &= -{\rm i} \,\hat{x}\,(\tilde{\phi}-\tilde{N})+ S^{-1}\,\hat{\nabla}^2\tilde{\psi},\\[0.5ex]
-{\rm i}\, n\,\omega_E\,\tau_H\,\tilde{N} &= {\rm i}\,n\,\omega_{\ast\,e}\,\tau_H\,\tilde{\phi}- {\rm i}\,\iota_e\,\hat{d}_\beta^{\,2}\,\hat{x}\,\hat{\nabla}^2\tilde{\psi}-{\rm i}\,c_\beta^{\,2}\,\hat{x}\,\tilde{V}  + S^{-1}\,P_E\,\hat{\nabla}^2 \tilde{N},\\[0.5ex]
-{\rm i}\,n\,(\omega_E+\omega_{\ast\,i})\,\tau_H\,\hat{\nabla}^2\tilde{\phi} &= -{\rm i}\,\hat{x}\,\hat{\nabla}^2\tilde{\psi}+S^{-1}\,P_\varphi\,\hat{\nabla}^4\!\left(\tilde{\phi} + \frac{\tilde{N}}{\iota}\right),\\[0.5ex]
-{\rm i}\,n\,\omega_E\,\tau_H\,\tilde{V} &= -{\rm i}\,n\,\omega_{\ast\,e}\,\tau_H\,\tilde{\psi} - {\rm i}\,\hat{x}\,\tilde{N}
+ S^{-1}\,P_\varphi\,\hat{\nabla}^2\tilde{V}.\label{e40}
\end{align}
Here, 
$\tau_H = L_s/(m\,V_A)$ 
is the  hydromagnetic time, 
$\omega_E =-(q_s/r_s)\,V_E(r_s) = -(d{\mit\Phi}/d\psi_p)_{r_s}$
  the 
 ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ frequency, 
$\omega_{\ast\,e} = \iota_e\,(q_s/r_s)V_\ast(r_s)= [(dp_e/d\psi_p)/(e\,n_e)]_{r_s}$
the electron diamagnetic frequency,
$\omega_{\ast\,i} =-\iota_i\,(m/r_s)V_\ast(r_s)=-[(dp_i/d\psi_p)/(e\,n_e)]_{r_s}$
 the  ion diamagnetic frequency,  ${\mit\Phi}(r)$ the equilibrium electrostatic potential, $S=\tau_R/\tau_H$ the  Lundquist number, 
$\tau_R = \mu_0\,r_s^{\,2}/\eta_\parallel$
 the
 resistive diffusion time,  $\tau_E = r_s^{\,2}/\chi_E$ the energy confinement time,
and $\tau_\varphi
= r_s^{\,2}/\chi_\varphi$
the  toroidal momentum confinement time.
Furthermore, $P_E = \tau_R/\tau_E$ and $P_\varphi = \tau_R/\tau_\varphi$ are magnetic Prandtl numbers.

 Let us define the stretched radial variable $X = S^{1/3}\,\hat{x}$.
Assuming that $X\sim{\cal O}(1)$ in the layer (i.e., assuming that the layer thickness is roughly of order $S^{-1/3}\,r_s$),
and making use of the fact that $S\gg 1$ in conventional tokamak plasmas,  Eqs.~(\ref{e37})--(\ref{e40}) reduce to the following
set of linear layer equations \cite{cole,rf2022}:
\begin{align}\label{e43xx}
{\rm i}\,(Q_E+ Q_e)\,\tilde{\psi}&= - {\rm i}\,X\left(\tilde{\phi}-\tilde{N}\right)+ \frac{d^{\,2}\tilde{\psi}}{d X^2},\\[0.5ex]
{\rm i}\,Q_E\,\tilde{N} &=  -{\rm i}\,Q_{e}\,\tilde{\phi}   - {\rm i} \,D^{2}\,X\,\frac{d^{\,2}\tilde{\psi}}{dX^{2}}- {\rm i}\,c_\beta^{\,2}\,X\,\tilde{V}
+ P_E\,\frac{d^{\,2} \tilde{N}}{dX^{2}},\label{e44xx}\\[0.5ex]
{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,\frac{d^{\,2}\tilde{\phi}}{dX^2}&= - {\rm i}\,X\,\frac{d^{\,2}\tilde{\psi}}{dX^2}+ P_\varphi\,\frac{d^{\,4}}{dX^4}\!\left(\tilde{\phi} + \frac{\tilde{N}}{\iota}\right),\\[0.5ex]
{\rm i}\,Q_E\,\tilde{V} &= {\rm i}\,Q_{e}\,\tilde{\psi} - {\rm i}\,X\,\tilde{N} + P_\varphi\,\frac{d^{\,2}\tilde{V}}{dX^{2}}.\label{e46}
\end{align}
Here, $Q_E=-S^{1/3}\,n\,\omega_E\,\tau_H$, $Q_{e,i} = -S^{1/3}\,n\,\omega_{\ast\,e,i}\,\tau_H$,
and $D = S^{1/3}\,\iota_e^{1/2}\,\hat{d}_\beta$. 

If we write $P_E = c_\beta^{\,2}$
then Eqs.~(\ref{e43xx})--(\ref{e46}) become equivalent to the set of  layer equations solved by Lee et alia. (To be slightly more exact, we
get from our equations to those of Lee et alia by making the following transformation: $Q_E\rightarrow Q$, $Q_e\rightarrow -Q_{\ast\,e}$, $Q_i\rightarrow -Q_{\ast\,i}$, $\iota\rightarrow 1/\tau$, $P_E\rightarrow c_\beta^{\,2}$,
 $P_\varphi\rightarrow P$, $\tilde{\psi}\rightarrow-\tilde{\psi}$, $\tilde{N}\rightarrow \tilde{Z}$, $\tilde{\phi}\rightarrow\tilde{\phi}$, and
$\tilde{V}\rightarrow-\tilde{V}_z$.)

The low-$\beta$ approximation used in Refs.~\cite{cole} and \cite{rf2022} involves neglecting the term
containing $c_\beta^{\,2}$ in Eq.~(\ref{e44xx}). This approximation decouples Eq.~(\ref{e46}) from the three preceding equations, and effectively
converts a four-field resonant response model into a three-field model. In the following, we shall not make use of this approximation.

\subsection{Asymptotic matching}
The  linear layer equations, (\ref{e43xx})--(\ref{e46}), possess tearing parity solutions
characterized by the symmetry $\tilde{\psi}(-X)=\tilde\psi(X)$, 
$\tilde{N}(-X)= - \tilde{N}(X)$, $\tilde{\phi}(-X)=-\tilde{\phi}(X)$,  $\tilde{V}(-X)=\tilde{V}(X)$.
As is easily demonstrated, the asymptotic behavior of the tearing parity solutions to Eqs.~(\ref{e43xx})--(\ref{e46}) are such that 
\begin{align}\label{e311}
\tilde{\psi}(X)&\rightarrow  \psi_0\left[\frac{\skew{6}\hat{\mit\Delta}}{2}\,|X| +1+ {\cal O}\left(\frac{1}{X^2}\right)\right],\\[0.5ex]
\skew{3}\tilde{\phi}(X)&\rightarrow -\psi_0\,Q_E\,\left[\frac{\skew{6}\hat{\mit\Delta}}{2}\,{\rm sgn}(X) +\frac{1}{X}+ {\cal O}\left(\frac{1}{X^2}\right)\right],\label{e312a}\\[0.5ex]
\tilde{N}(X) & \rightarrow \psi_0\,Q_{e}\left[\frac{\skew{6}\hat{\mit\Delta}}{2}\,{\rm sgn}(X) +\frac{1}{X}+ {\cal O}\left(\frac{1}{X^2}\right)\right],\label{e3.13a}\\[0.5ex]
\tilde{V}(X)&\rightarrow {\cal O}\left(\frac{1}{X^3}\right)\label{e3.14a}
\end{align}
as $|X|\rightarrow\infty$, where $\psi_0$ is an arbitrary constant. 
It follows from Eq.~(\ref{e4g}) that layer response index is
\begin{equation}\label{e48}
{\mit\Delta}_s= S^{1/3}\,\hat{\mit\Delta}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Fourier transformation}
Equations~(\ref{e43xx})--(\ref{e46}) are most conveniently solved in Fourier transform space \cite{cole}.
Let
\begin{equation}
\bar{\phi}(p) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tilde{\phi}(X)\,{\rm e}^{-{\rm i}\,p\,X}\,dX,
\end{equation}
et cetera. The Fourier transformed linear layer equations become
\begin{align}\label{e314}
{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e)\,\bar{\psi}&=\frac{d}{dp}\!\left(\bar{\phi}-\bar{N}\right)-p^2\,\bar{\psi},\\[0.5ex]
{\rm i}\,Q_E\,\bar{N} &= - {\rm i}\,Q_{e}\,\bar{\phi} -D^{\,2}\,\frac{d(p^2\,\bar{\psi})}{dp}+ c_\beta^{\,2}\,\frac{d\bar{V}}{dp}
  - P_E\,p^2\bar{N},\label{e316}\\[0.5ex]
{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,p^2\,\bar{\phi}&=  \frac{d(p^2\,\bar{\psi})}{dp}- P_\varphi\,p^4\!\left(\bar{\phi} + \frac{\bar{N}}{\iota}\right),\label{e316a}\\[0.5ex]
{\rm i}\,Q_E\,\bar{V} &= {\rm i}\,Q_{e}\,\bar{\psi} +\frac{d\bar{N}}{dp}- P_\varphi\,p^2\,\bar{V},\label{e317}
\end{align}
where, for a tearing parity solution, 
\begin{equation}\label{e41}
\bar{\phi}(p)-\bar{N}(p)\equiv\bar{Y} (p)\rightarrow \bar{Y}_0\!\left[\frac{\hat{\mit\Delta}}{\pi\,p} + 1+ {\cal O}(p)\right]
\end{equation}
as $p\rightarrow 0$. Here,  $\bar{Y}_0$ is an arbitrary constant. 

Finally, if we define 
\begin{align}
\bar{J}(p)&= p^2\,\bar{\psi},
\end{align}
then Eqs.~(\ref{e314})--(\ref{e317}) can be converted into the following equivalent set of four coupled first-order o.d.e.s:
\begin{align}\label{e1}
\frac{d\bar{Y}}{dp} &= \left[\frac{\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e)+p^2}{p^2}\right]\bar{J},\\[0.5ex]
\frac{d\bar{N}}{dp} &= -\left(\frac{{\rm i}\,Q_e}{p^2}\right)\bar{J} + (\,{\rm i}\,Q_E + P_\varphi\,p^2)\,\bar{V},\\[0.5ex]
\frac{d\bar{J}}{dp} &= [\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,p^2 + P_\varphi\,p^4]\,\bar{Y}
+ [\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,p^2 + \iota_e^{\,-1}\,P_\varphi\,p^4]\,\bar{N},\\[0.5ex]
c_\beta^{\,2}\,\frac{d\bar{V}}{dp} &= [\,{\rm i}\,Q_e+ {\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,D^{\,2}\,p^2 + D^{\,2}\,P_\varphi\,p^4]\,\bar{Y}
\nonumber\\[0.5ex]&\phantom{=} +\{\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e) + [P_E+{\rm i}\,(Q_E + Q_i) \,D^{\,2}]\,p^2 + \iota_e^{\,-1}\,D^{\,2}\,P_\varphi\,p^4\}\,\bar{N},\label{e4}
\end{align}
Note that $\iota_e= -Q_e/(Q_i-Q_e)$. 

\subsection{Small argument expansion}
Let us search for power-law solutions of Eqs.~(\ref{e1})--(\ref{e4}) at small values of $p$. Given that we have four coupled first-order o.d.e.s,
we expect to find four independent power-law solutions.
The first solution is
such that
\begin{align}
\bar{Y}(p) &= {\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e)\,a_{-1}\,p^{-1} -\left[\frac{{\rm i}}{2}\,Q_E\,(Q_E+Q_e)\,(Q_E+Q_i) +1\right]a_{-1}\,p +{\cal O}(p^3),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{N}(p)&= -{\rm i}\,Q_e\,a_{-1}\, p^{-1} + \frac{{\rm i}}{2}\,Q_E\,Q_e\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,a_{-1}\,p + {\cal O}(p^3),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{J}(p)&= -a_{-1}- \frac{1}{2}\,Q_E\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,a_{-1}\,p^2 +{\cal O}(p^4),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{V}(p)&=- \frac{[\,{\rm i}\,Q_e\,(1+P_E) +Q_E\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,D^{\,2}]}{2\,c_\beta^{\,2}}\,a_{-1}\,p^2+{\cal O}(p^4),
\end{align}
where $a_{-1}$ is an arbitrary constant. 
The second solution is such that
\begin{align}
\bar{Y}(p) &= {\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e)\,a_0-\frac{{\rm i}}{6}\,Q_E\,(Q_E+Q_e)\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,a_0\,p^2 +{ \cal O}(p^4),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{N}(p) &= -{\rm i}\,Q_e\,a_0+\frac{{\rm i}}{6}\,Q_E\,Q_e\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,a_0\,p^2+{\cal O}(p^4),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{J}(p)&= -\frac{1}{3}\,Q_E\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,a_0\,p^3+{\cal O}(p^5),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{V}(p)&= -\frac{1}{3}\,\frac{[\,{\rm i}\,Q_e\,P_E + Q_E\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,D^{\,2}]}{c_\beta^{\,2}}\,a_0\,p^3+{\cal O}(p^5),
\end{align}
where $a_0$ is an arbitrary constant. 
The third solution is such that
\begin{align}
\bar{Y}(p) &= -\frac{1}{6}\,(Q_E+Q_e)\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,a_2\,p^2+{\cal O}(p^4),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{N}(p) &= a_2+\frac{{\rm i}}{2}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\left(-\frac{{\rm i}}{3}\,Q_e\,+ \frac{g}{c_\beta^{\,2}}\right)a_2\,p^2+{\cal O}(p^4),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{J}(p) &=\frac{{\rm i}}{3}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,a_2\,p^3+{\cal O}(p^5),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{V}(p) &={\rm i}\,\frac{(Q_E+Q_e)}{c_\beta^{\,2}}\,a_2\,p+{\cal O}(p^3),
\end{align}
where $a_2$ is an arbitrary constant. 
The final solution is such that
\begin{align}
\bar{Y}(p)& =- \frac{{\rm i}}{12}\,Q_E\,(Q_E+Q_e)\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,a_3\,p^3+{\cal O}(p^5),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{N}(p) &=-{\rm i}\, Q_E\,a_3\,p+{\cal O}(p^3),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{J}(p)&= -\frac{1}{4}\,Q_E\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,a_3\,p^4+{\cal O}(p^6),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{V}(p) &=- \frac{Q_E\,(Q_E+Q_e)}{2\,c_\beta^{\,2}}\,a_3\,p^2+{\cal O}(p^4),
\end{align}
where $a_3$ is an arbitrary constant. Note, however, that the third solution is not consistent with Eqs.~(\ref{e311})--(\ref{e3.14a}), which mandate that 
$\bar{N}(p) \rightarrow- [Q_e/(Q_E+Q_e)]\,\bar{Y}(p) + {\cal O}(p)$ and  $\bar{V}(p)\rightarrow {\cal O}(p^2)$
as $p\rightarrow 0$. Hence, we deduce that $a_2=0$. 

We conclude that, at small values of $p$, the most general solution for $\bar{Y}(p)$ and $\bar{N}(p)$ takes the form 
\begin{align}\label{yy}
\bar{Y}(p) &= {\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e)\,(a_{-1} \,p^{-1}+a_0)+ {\cal O}(p),\\[0.5ex]
\bar{N}(p) &= -{\rm i}\,Q_e\,(a_{-1}\,p^{-1} +a_0)+ {\cal O}(p),\label{nn}
\end{align}
which is consistent with Eqs.~(\ref{e311})--(\ref{e3.14a}).

\subsection{Ricatti matrix differential equation}
Let
\begin{align}
\underline{u}&= \left(\begin{array}{c}\bar{Y}\\\bar{N}\end{array}\right),\\[0.5ex]
\underline{v}&= \left(\begin{array}{c}\bar{J}\\c_\beta^{\,2}\,\bar{V}\end{array}\right).
\end{align}
Equations~(\ref{e1})--(\ref{e4}) can be written in the form 
\begin{align}
\frac{d\underline{u}}{dp}= \underline{\underline{A}}\,\underline{v},\\[0.5ex]
\frac{d\underline{v}}{dp}= \underline{\underline{B}}\,\underline{u},
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
A_{11} &=  \frac{{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e)+p^2}{p^2},\\[0.5ex]
A_{12}&=0,\\[0.5ex]
A_{21} &=- \frac{{\rm i}\,Q_e}{p^2},\\[0.5ex]
A_{22} &= \frac{{\rm i}\,Q_E + P_\varphi\,p^2}{c_\beta^{\,2}},\\[0.5ex]
B_{11} &= {\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,p^2 + P_\varphi\,p^4,\\[0.5ex]
B_{12} &= {\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,p^2 + \iota_e^{\,-1}\,P_\varphi\,p^4,\\[0.5ex]
B_{21}&= {\rm i}\,Q_e+ {\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,D^{\,2}\,p^2 + D^{\,2}\,P_\varphi\,p^4,\\[0.5ex]
B_{22} & ={\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e) + [P_E + {\rm i}\,(Q_E +Q_i)\,D^{\,2}]\,p^2 + \iota_e^{\,-1}\,D^{\,2}\,P_\varphi\,p^4.
\end{align}
Thus, we obtain the following matrix differential equation: 
\begin{equation}\label{mat}
\frac{d}{dp}\!\left(\underline{\underline{A}}^{-1}\,\frac{d\underline{u}}{dp}\right) = \underline{\underline{B}}\,\underline{u}.
\end{equation}

Let
\begin{equation}\label{wdef}
 p\,\frac{d\underline{u}}{dp}=\underline{\underline{W}}\,\underline{u}.
\end{equation}
The previous two equations can be combined to give 
\begin{equation}
\left(p\,\frac{d\underline{\underline{W}}}{dp} - \underline{\underline{W}} 
+ \underline{\underline{W}}\,\underline{\underline{W}} + \underline{\underline{A}}\,p\,\frac{d\underline{\underline{A}}^{-1}}{dp}\,\underline{\underline{W}}- p^2\,\underline{\underline{A}}\,\underline{\underline{B}}\right)\underline{u} = \underline{0},
\end{equation}
which  yields the Riccati matrix differential equation, 
\begin{equation}\label{ricc}
p\,\frac{d\underline{\underline{W}}}{dp} = \underline{\underline{W}} - \underline{\underline{W}}\,\underline{\underline{W}} - \underline{\underline{E}}\,\underline{\underline{W}}
+\underline{\underline{F}},
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{align}
\underline{\underline{E}}(p) &= 
\underline{\underline{A}}\,p\,\frac{d\underline{\underline{A}}^{-1}}{dp},\\[0.5ex]
\underline{\underline{F}}(p)&= p^2\,\underline{\underline{A}}\,\underline{\underline{B}}.
\end{align}
In fact, it is easily demonstrated that
\begin{align}\label{ee1}
E_{11} &= \frac{2\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e)}{{\rm i}\,(Q_E+ Q_e)+p^2},\\[0.5ex]
E_{12}&= 0,\\[0.5ex]
E_{21} &=-\frac{2\,{\rm i}\,Q_e\,(\,{\rm i}\,Q_E+2\,P_\varphi\,p^2)}{[\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e)+p^2]\,(\,{\rm i}\,Q_E+P_\varphi\,p^2)},\\[0.5ex]
E_{22} &= -\frac{2\,P_\varphi\,p^2}{{\rm i}\,Q_E+ P_\varphi\,p^2},\label{ee4}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}\label{f1}
F_{11} &= p^2\,[\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e)+p^2]\,[\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i) + P_\varphi\,p^2],\\[0.5ex]
F_{12} &= p^2\,[\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e)+p^2]\,[\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i) + \iota_e^{\,-1}\,P_\varphi\,p^2],\\[0.5ex]
F_{21} &=-{\rm i}\,Q_e\,p^2\,[\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i)+P_\varphi\,p^2]\nonumber\\[0.5ex]
&\phantom{=} + c_\beta^{\,-2}\,p^2\,(\,{\rm i}\,Q_E+P_\varphi\,p^2)\,[\,{\rm i}\,Q_e+ {\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,D^{\,2}\,p^2 + D^{\,2}\,P_\varphi\,p^4],\\[0.5ex]
F_{22} &=-{\rm i}\,Q_e\,p^2\,[\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i)+\iota_e^{\,-1}\,P_\varphi\,p^2]\nonumber\\[0.5ex] 
&\phantom{=}+c_\beta^{\,-2}\,p^2\,(\,{\rm i}\,Q_E+P_\varphi\,p^2)\,\{\,{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_e) + [P_E +{\rm i}\,(Q_E + Q_i)\,D^{\,2}]\,p^2 + \iota_e^{\,-1}\,D^{\,2}\,P_\varphi\,p^4\}.\label{f4}
\end{align}

Finally, if 
\begin{equation}
\underline{\underline{W}}(p)= \left(\begin{array}{cc} W_{11},&W_{12}\\W_{21},&W_{22}\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
then Eq.~(\ref{ricc}) yields 
\begin{align}\label{err1}
p\,\frac{dW_{11}}{dp}  &= W_{11}  - W_{11}\,W_{11}-W_{12}\,W_{21}- E_{11}\,W_{11} + F_{11},\\[0.5ex]
p\,\frac{dW_{12}}{dp} &= W_{12} - W_{11}\,W_{12} - W_{12}\,W_{22} - E_{11}\,W_{12} + F_{12},\\[0.5ex]
p\,\frac{dW_{21}}{dp} &= W_{21} -W_{21}\,W_{11}- W_{22}\,W_{21} - E_{21}\,W_{11} - E_{22}\,W_{21} + F_{21},\\[0.5ex]
p\,\frac{dW_{22}}{dp} &= W_{22} -W_{21}\,W_{12}- W_{22}\,W_{22}- E_{21}\,W_{12} - E_{22}\,W_{22} + F_{22}.\label{err4}
\end{align}
Thus, our final system of equations consists of a set of four coupled nonlinear differential equations. 

\subsection{Small-argument behavior of Riccati matrix differential equation}
It follows from Eqs.~(\ref{ee1})--(\ref{ee4})  that  $\underline{\underline{E}}(p) = \underline{\underline{E}}^{\,(0)} + {\cal O}(p^2)$ at small values of $p$,
where 
\begin{align}
E_{11}^{\,(0)} &= 2,\\[0.5ex]
E_{12}^{\,(0)}&=0,\\[0.5ex]
E_{21}^{\,(0)} &= - \frac{2\,Q_e}{Q_E+Q_e},\label{e210}\\[0.5ex]
E_{22}^{\,(0)}&= 0.
\end{align}
Likewise,  Eqs.~(\ref{f1})--(\ref{f4}) imply that $\underline{\underline{F}}(p) ={\cal O}(p^2)$.

Suppose that  $\underline{\underline{W}}(p)= \underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(0)}+ \underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(1)}\,p$ at small values of $p$,
where the elements of  $\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(0)}$ and $\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(1)}$ are independent of $p$. 
Equation~(\ref{ricc}) gives
\begin{align}
\underline{\underline{0}}&= \underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(0)}-\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(0)}\,\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(0)}- 
\underline{\underline{E}}^{\,(0)}\,\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(0)},\\[0.5ex]
\underline{\underline{0}}&= -\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(1)}\,\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(0)}-\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(0)}\,\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(1)}- 
\underline{\underline{E}}^{\,(0)}\,\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(1)}.
\end{align}
Suitable solutions are
\begin{align}\label{w0def}
\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(0)} &=  \left(\begin{array}{cc} -1,&0\\-E_{21}^{\,(0)}/2,&0\end{array}\right),\\[0.5ex]
W_{12}^{\,(1)} &= 0,\\[0.5ex]
W_{21}^{\,(1)}& = \frac{E_{21}^{\,(0)}}{2}\left[W_{11}^{\,(1)}- W_{22}^{\,(1)}\right].\label{w21def}
\end{align}

At small values of $p$, let
\begin{align}
\underline{u}(p) &= \underline{u}_{-1}\,p^{-1} + \underline{u}_0,
\end{align}
where the elements of  $\underline{u}_{-1}$ (which are $y_{-1}$ and $n_{-1}$, respectively) and the elements of $\underline{u}_{0}$ (which are $y_0$ 
and $n_0$, respectively) are all constants.
Equation~(\ref{wdef}) gives 
\begin{align}
\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(0)}\,\underline{u}_{-1} &= - \underline{u}_{-1},\\[0.5ex]
\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(0)}\,\underline{u}_{0} + \underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(1)}\,\underline{u}_{-1} &=\underline{0}.\label{w1def}
\end{align}
Thus, making use of Eq.~(\ref{w0def}), we get
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{cc} -1,&0\\ -E_{21}^{\,(0)}/2,&0\end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{c}y_{-1}\\ n_{-1}\end{array}\right)= -\left(\begin{array}{c}y_{-1}\\ n_{-1}\end{array}\right),
\end{equation}
which implies that
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{21}^{\,(0)}}{2}\,y_{-1}= - \frac{Q_e}{Q_E+Q_e}\,y_{-1} = n_{-1},
\end{equation}
in accordance with Eqs.~(\ref{yy}) and (\ref{nn}), where use has been made of Eq.~(\ref{e210}). 
Equations~(\ref{w0def})--(\ref{w21def})  and (\ref{w1def})  yield
\begin{equation}
\frac{y_0}{y_{-1}}= W_{11}^{\,(1)},
\end{equation}
with $n_0$ undetermined. 
It follows from Equation~(\ref{e41}) that 
\begin{equation}\label{e111}
\frac{\pi}{\hat{\mit\Delta}}\equiv \frac{y_0}{y_{-1}} = W_{11}^{\,(1)} = \frac{dW_{11}(0)}{dp}.
\end{equation}
Note, incidentally, that the result $\pi/\hat{\mit\Delta}=y_0/y_{-1}$ follows directly from Eq.~(\ref{e43xx}), and would hold even if $a_2$ were non-zero. 

\subsection{Large-argument behavior of Riccati matrix differential equation}
At large values of $p$, it is clear from Eqs.~(\ref{f1})--(\ref{f4}) that  $\underline{\underline{F}}(p)=\underline{\underline{F}}^{\,(6)}\,p^6+ 
\underline{\underline{F}}^{\,(8)}\,p^8$, where the elements of $\underline{\underline{F}}^{\,(6)}$ and $\underline{\underline{F}}^{\,(8)}$ are independent ot $p$.
On the other hand, Eqs.~(\ref{ee1})--(\ref{ee4}) imply that $\underline{\underline{E}}(p)=\underline{\underline{E}}^{\,(0)}$, 
where the elements of $\underline{\underline{E}}^{\,(0)}$ are independent of $p$. 
Thus, if we write $\underline{\underline{W}}(p) =\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(2)}\,p^2+\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(4)}\,p^4$,
where the elements of $\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(2)}$ and  $\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(4)}$ are independent of $p$, then Eq.~(\ref{ricc}) gives 
\begin{align}\label{e138}
\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(4)}\,\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(4)}&= \underline{\underline{F}}^{\,(8)},\\[0.5ex]
\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(2)}\,\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(4)}+ \underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(4)}\,\underline{\underline{W}}^{\,(2)}&= 
\underline{\underline{F}}^{\,(6)}.\label{e139}
\end{align}
Now, according to Eqs.~(\ref{f1})--(\ref{f4}), 
\begin{align}
F^{\,(8)}_{11} &=0,\\[0.5ex]
F^{\,(8)}_{12} &= 0,\\[0.5ex]
F^{\,(8)}_{21} &= c_\beta^{\,-2}\,D^{\,2}\,P_\varphi^{\,2},\\[0.5ex]
F^{\,(8)}_{22} &= c_\beta^{\,-2}\,\iota_e^{\,-1}\,D^{\,2}\,P_\varphi^{\,2},
\end{align}
so Eq.~(\ref{e138}) yields 
\begin{align}
W^{\,(4)}_{11} &=0,\\[0.5ex]
W^{\,(4)}_{12} &= 0,\\[0.5ex]
W^{\,(4)}_{21} &= -c_\beta^{\,-1}\,\iota_e^{\,1/2}\,D\,P_\varphi,\\[0.5ex]
W^{\,(4)}_{22} &=-c_\beta^{\,-1}\,\iota_e^{\,-1/2}\, D\,P_\varphi,
\end{align}
where we have chosen the sign of the square root that is associated with well-behaved solutions at large values of $p$. Here, we are  assuming that $\iota_e>0$. 
Equations~(\ref{f1})--(\ref{f4}) also give 
\begin{align}
F^{\,(6)}_{11} &=P_\varphi,\\[0.5ex]
F^{\,(6)}_{12} &= \iota_e^{\,-1}\,P_\varphi,\\[0.5ex]
F^{\,(6)}_{21} &={\rm i}\,c_\beta^{\,-2}\,Q_E\,D^{\,2}\,P_\varphi + {\rm i}\,c_\beta^{\,-2}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,D^{\,2}\,P_\varphi,\\[0.5ex]
F^{\,(6)}_{22} &={\rm i}\,c_\beta^{\,-2}\,\iota_e^{\,-1}\,Q_E\,D^{\,2}\,P_\varphi + c_\beta^{\,-2}\,[P_E+{\rm i}\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,D^{\,2}]\,P_\varphi.
\end{align}
Thus, Eq.~(\ref{e139}) yields
\begin{align}
W_{12}^{\,(2)}\,W_{21}^{\,(4)} &= F_{11}^{\,(6)},\\[0.5ex]
W_{12}^{\,(2)}\,W_{22}^{\,(4)} &= F_{12}^{\,(6)},
\end{align}
which gives 
\begin{align}
W_{12}^{\,(2)} &= - c_\beta\,\iota_e^{\,-1/2}\,D^{-1}.
\end{align}

Now, if
\begin{equation}\label{e155}
\underline{\underline{W}}\,\underline{u}= \lambda(p)\,\underline{u}
\end{equation}
then Eq.~(\ref{wdef}) yields
\begin{equation}
p\,\frac{d\underline{u}}{dp} = \lambda\,\underline{u},
\end{equation}
which implies that
\begin{equation}
\underline{u}(p) = \underline{u}(p_0)\,\exp\left[\int_{p_0}^p\frac{\lambda_r(p')}{p'}\,dp'\right]\exp\left[\,{\rm i}\!\int_{p_0}^p\frac{\lambda_i(p')}{p'}\,dp'\right], 
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_r$  and $\lambda_i$ are the real and imaginary parts of $\lambda$, respectively. 
Of course, a solution that is well behaved at large values of $p$ is such that $\lambda_r$ is negative. As we have seen, the large-$p$ limit of
Eq.~(\ref{ricc}) is
\begin{equation}
\underline{\underline{W}}\,\underline{\underline{W}} = \underline{\underline{F}}.
\end{equation}
Hence, if
\begin{equation}\label{e158}
 \underline{\underline{F}}\,\underline{u} = {\mit\Lambda}\,\underline{u}
 \end{equation}
 then Eqs.~(\ref{e155}) and (\ref{e158}) imply that 
 \begin{equation}
 \lambda^2 = {\mit\Lambda}.
 \end{equation}
 The eigenvalue problem for the $F$-matrix reduces to
 \begin{equation}
 {\mit\Lambda}^{\,2}- (F_{11}+ F_{22})\,{\mit\Lambda} + F_{11}\,F_{22} - F_{12}\,F_{21}=0.
 \end{equation}
 Now,
 \begin{align}
 F_{11}+F_{22}&\simeq  F_{22}^{\,(8)}\,p^8 =c_\beta^{\,-2}\, \iota_e^{\,-1}\,D^{\,2}\,P_\varphi^{\,2}\,p^8,\\[0.5ex]
 F_{11}\,F_{22} - F_{12}\,F_{21}&  \simeq \left[F_{11}^{\,(6)}\,F_{22}^{\,(8)} - F_{12}^{\,(6)}\,F_{21}^{\,(8)}\right]p^{14}\nonumber\\[0.5ex]&\phantom{=}+\left[F_{11}^{\,(6)}\,F_{22}^{\,(6)} - F_{12}^{\,(6)}\,F_{21}^{\,(6)}\right]p^{12}
=c_\beta^{\,-2}\,R\,P_\varphi^{\,2}\,p^{12},
 \end{align}
  where 
 \begin{equation}
 R= P_E + {\rm i}\,(1-\iota_e^{\,-1})\,(Q_E+Q_i)\,D^{\,2},
 \end{equation}
Hence, the two eigenvalues of the $F$-matrix are
 \begin{align}
 {\mit\Lambda}_1&\simeq F_{22}^{\,(8)}\,p^8=  c_\beta^{\,-2}\,\iota_e^{\,-1}\,D^2\,P_\varphi^{\,2}\,p^8,\\[0.5ex]
 {\mit\Lambda}_2 &\simeq \frac{[F_{11}^{\,(6)}\,F_{22}^{\,(6)} - F_{12}^{\,(6)}\,F_{21}^{\,(6)}]}{F_{22}^{\,(8)}}\,p^4= \iota_e\,D^{-2}\,R\,p^4.
 \end{align}
 Thus, we deduce that the two eigenvalues of the $W$-matrix are 
 \begin{align}\label{l1}
 \lambda_1&=-{\mit\Lambda}_1^{\,1/2}= -c_\beta^{\,-1}\,\iota_e^{\,-1/2}\,D\,P_\varphi\,p^4,\\[0.5ex]
 \lambda_2&=-{\mit\Lambda}_2^{\,1/2}=-\iota_e^{\,1/2}\,D^{-1}\,R^{\,1/2}\,p^2,
 \end{align}
 Here, the square root of $R$ is taken such that the real part of $\lambda_2$ is negative. 
  Now, the eigenvalue problem for the $W$-matrix reduces to 
 \begin{equation}
 \lambda^{2} - W_{22}^{\,(4)}\,p^4\,\lambda + \left[W_{11}^{\,(2)}\,W_{22}^{\,(4)} - W_{12}^{\,(2)}\,W_{21}^{\,(4)}\right]p^6 = 0.
 \end{equation}
which yields
\begin{equation}
\lambda_1\simeq W_{22}^{\,(4)}\,p^4,
\end{equation}
which is in agreement with Eq.~(\ref{l1}), and
\begin{equation}
\lambda_2 \simeq \left[W_{11}^{\,(2)} - \frac{W_{12}^{\,(2)}\,W_{21}^{\,(4)}}{W_{22}^{\,(4)}}\right]p^2,
\end{equation}
 which implies that
 \begin{equation}
 W_{11}^{\,(2)} = -\iota_e^{\,1/2}\,D^{-1}\,R^{\,1/2}-c_\beta\,\iota_e^{\,1/2}\,D^{-1}.
 \end{equation}
 Hence, the large-$p$ boundary condition for the $W$-matrix
 is
 \begin{equation}\label{e147}
 \underline{\underline{W}}(p) =  \left(\begin{array}{cc} -\iota_e^{\,1/2}\,D^{-1}\,R^{\,1/2}\,p^2-c_\beta\,\iota_e^{\,1/2}\,D^{-1}\,p^2,& - c_\beta\,\iota_e^{\,-1/2}\,D^{-1}\,p^2\\-c_\beta^{\,-1}\,\iota_e^{\,1/2}\,D\,P_\varphi\,p^4,&-c_\beta^{\,-1}\,\iota_e^{\,-1/2}\,D\,P_\varphi\,p^4\end{array}\right).
 \end{equation}

\subsection{Method of solution}
The method of solution is to launch the well-behaved asymptotic solution (\ref{e147}) of Eqs.~(\ref{err1})--(\ref{err4}) from large $p$, and then
integrate the equations backward to small $p$. The scaled layer response index, $\hat{\mit\Delta}$, is then determined  from Eq.~(\ref{e111}). 
Note that, because there are no free parameters in expression (\ref{e147}), the scaled layer response index is uniquely determined by this procedure. 
Finally, the true layer response index is given by ${\mit\Delta}_s= S^{\,1/3}\,\hat{\mit\Delta}$. [See Eq.~(\ref{e48}).]
